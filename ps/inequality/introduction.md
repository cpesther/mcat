Social inequality refers to the phenomenon in which the **resources in a society are unevenly distributed** between its members. The term "resources" includes a wide variety of differing factors, including (but not limited to), financial resouces, access to education, and availability of healthcare.

A prime example social inequality is the wealth gap in the United States. As reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the top 10% of households have on average around $6.7 million in wealth, but this represents a total of 66.9% of all wealth as a group. Contrarily, the bottom 50% of households have only $50,000 on average, which accounts for just 2.5% of the total household wealth. In a perfectly equal society, any random selection of 10% of the total households would also represent 10% of the totoal wealth; however, this is not the case, thereby indicating a level of social inequality.

Social inequality is itself is not applied equally across all populations, as racial and ethnic minorities are frequently disproportionally represented in lower social classes. Additionally, gender can also play a role in a persons social disadvantage. Some data suggest that being female comes with disadvantages such as the gender wage gap (wherein females are paid, on average, less than males) or the **glass ceiling**, which describes an invisible barrier preventing females or members of certain racial or ethnic groups from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy, most often in the context of job promotions and corporate structure.
