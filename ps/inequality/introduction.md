# Introduction to Social Inequality
Social inequality refers to the phenomenon in which the **resources in a society are unevenly distributed** between its members. These resources include a wide variety of differing concepts, including (but not limited to), financial resouces, access to education, and availability of healthcare.

A prime example social inequality is the wealth gap in the United States. As reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, on average, the top 10% of household have around $6.7 million, controlling a total of 66.9% of all wealth as a group. Contrarily, the bottom 50% of households have only $50,000 on average, and control just 2.5% of the total household wealth as a group.
