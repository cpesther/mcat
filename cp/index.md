# Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems
The Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems section of the MCAT assesses knowledge of the basic principles of chemistry and physics as they relate to biological systems. It covers topics like chemical bonding, thermodynamics, kinetics, fluid dynamics, electrochemistry, acids and bases, and the structure and function of organic molecules. The section also explores concepts such as energy, motion, and waves.
