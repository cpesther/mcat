# Vectors and Scalars
**Vectors** and **scalars** are two different types of quantities used in math and physics. The key difference between the two is that *scalar quantities include only a magnitude component* while a *vector quantity includes both magnitude and direction.*

## Common Examples
| Scalars | Vectors |
| -- | -- |
| Mass | Velocity |
| Temperature | Displacement | 
| Time | Force |

## Why Does It Matter?
Scalars are simple, they act just like the numbers that we have been adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividng since elementary school, but *vectors don't always follow the same mathematical patterns that we are accustomed to.* 

> **Example: Scalar Addition**
> $$ 100\space g + 200\space g = 300\space g$$
>Scalars always follow the "normal" mathematical rules that we know. 

> **Example: Vector Addition**
> $$ 10\space \frac{m}{s} + 10\space \frac{m}{s} \neq 20\space \frac{m}{s}$$
>However, vectors aren't always as intuitive. Two vectors both with magnitude of 10 meters per second don't always add to a vector with magniude of 20 meters per second. It is possible that they could, but it ultimately *depends on their direction.* The following example demonstrates why.
