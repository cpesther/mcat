![Cover image](assets/cover_physical.jpg)

Physics provides the foundational principles that explain the behavior of matter and energy, which are essential for understanding the functioning of biological systems. By mastering concepts such as forces, motion, energy transfer, and electromagnetism, healthcare professionals can better grasp the physical mechanisms behind vital processes like circulation, respiration, and neural activity. This knowledge enhances clinical practice by informing diagnostic techniques, medical imaging technologies, and therapeutic interventions.
